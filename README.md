### Hi there üëã My name is Myka! (my-kuh)

- üí¨ I am a software engineer & full-stack web developer and recently obtained my B.A. in Computer Science from Boston University (graduated August 2022 üë©‚Äçüéì). My passion for software development grew after taking UCLA's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in 2020, where I collaborated with mentors and teams to create full-stack web projects in Javascript and React.

- Recent Projects
  - üå± My most recently completed project is [Ransomwhere?](https://github.com/cs501-ransomwhere), a Command and Control (C2) framework that allows for remote operators to authenticate and connect to a C2 server and task any registered malicious implants. Our implant is a 2-staged malware that utilizes PNG-based steganography to obfuscate payloads into PNG image pixel bits and reflectively inject the final payload as a dropper. The C2 server and implant communicate using a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption methods, RSA and AES cryptography. All remote operators connect to the server over TCP sockets with SSH tunneling to defend from network attacks.
  - ‚ú® I‚Äôve just wrapped up a React web app team project utilizing a Firebase backend. Our application, [Minute](https://minute-app.herokuapp.com/), provides users with a practical solution to practice public speaking and build confidence for daily conversations, presentations, and interviews. Taking inspiration from a practical "one-minute word challenge" exercise, users are able to speak about a random topic for 60 seconds and receive feedback about their speech patterns. The customizable topic selector also allows users to create their own prompts and record shorter or longer presentations. [Code Repository](https://github.com/andyyvo/minute-react)
  - ‚úîÔ∏è Another project I collaborated on is [Tempo Keeper](https://github.com/mykakugaya/tempo-keeper), an Android mobile application in Java with a Firebase backend that allows users to customize their running routes and play music that dynamically changes to match their live running pace. I worked with an agile development team on a weekly scrum master rotation to implement Spotify, Google Directions, and Google Elevations APIs.
