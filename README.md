- üí¨ I am a software engineer and full-stack web developer, currently pursuing my BA in Computer Science at Boston University (expected graduation 6/2022). My passion for software development grew after taking UCLA's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in 2020, where I collaborated with mentors and teams to create web projects in Javascript and React.

- ‚ö° My most recently completed project is Tempo Keeper, an Android mobile application in Java with a Firebase backend that allows users to customize their running routes and play music that dynamically changes to match their live running pace. I worked with an agile development team on a weekly scrum master rotation to implement Spotify, Google Directions, and Google Elevations APIs. 

- ‚ú® I‚Äôm currently working with a team on an agile mobile app development project utilizing React Native and a Firebase backend. Our application, Minute, provides users with a practical solution to practice public speaking and build confidence for daily conversations, presentations, and interviews.

- üå± I‚Äôm also currently learning how to analyze cyberattack TTPs in a malware reverse engineering course using C/C++. By identifying harmful IOCs in malware through a VirtualBox VM, we utilize Ghidra, PE-Bear, and other debugging platforms to identify how/what/why the malware is running.
